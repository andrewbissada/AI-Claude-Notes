n8n is an open-source, workflow automation and integration platform designed to connect various apps, services, and systems visually and programmatically. 
It enables users to build automated pipelines—so-called “workflows”—without needing extensive coding, yet gives developers the flexibility to extend via 
custom code or self-hosting.

N8n vs Zapier/Make:
* Zapier: Easiest
* Make (Integromat): Moderate
* n8n: Steeper learning curve; designed for developers & power users. Open source. Able to self host.



Nodes fall into categories:
*  Trigger Nodes: Event-based (e.g., “On form submission”) — no API call, just a listener.
*  Action Nodes: Often API calls (e.g., Slack, Jira, Google Sheets).
*  Logic Nodes: No API calls — just control flow (if/else, loops, merge).
*  Data Nodes: Transform/manipulate data (formatting text, parsing JSON).
*  Code Nodes: Run custom JavaScript — no external API unless you add one.
